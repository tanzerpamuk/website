    <h1 id="top">IS SECURITY A PRIORITY</h1>

<section class="first"> According to a report by the International Telecommunication Union in 2015, 3.2 billion people use the internet globally. That is almost a seven-fold increase from 7% in 2000 to 43% of the global population today. (<a href="#one" class="colour">International Telecommunication Union, 2015, May 26</a>) The number of people using the internet and smart devices is increasing rapidly and that increase has led users to leave their footprint in the vast space of internet. Online banking, social networking, job searching, online shopping, are now important part of our lives. Whilst it is the responsibility of an organization to protect the personal information that consumers provide to them, consumers should also take precaution to ensure they are doing their part in protecting their own personal information. (<a href="#one" class="colour">Data Protection Act</a>) Do we take enough precaution not to expose too much personal information online? Do organisations employ necessary security enforcements to keep consumers’ precious information secure? </section>
<section class="second">In the light of the personal information of 500 million people which was stolen from Yahoo in 2014, security threats to personal data are emerging in huge level. (<a href="#one" class="colour">World's Biggest Data Breaches</a>) It is surprising to find out how much information we reveal online without realizing it. Think about how much personal information is simply given to an internet service provider when signing up to use the internet. Name, surname, email address, bank account details. This information is stored on the internet service provider database to their level of security but that does not mean we can expect organisations to take full responsibility for everything. The Information Commissioners’ Office suggest that when we do any online transaction we should use the same common sense that we would when asked for personal information face to face; Who is collecting the information, Is it necessary, what will be done with it and what are the consequences for the user? (<a href="#one" class="colour">Online Safety</a>) Answering technology related question in her New York Times column, J.D Biersdorfer explains how important it is to take extra steps in keeping personal information secure. Having a strong password and a two-step verification for important websites are some of the precautions users can take. (<a href="#one" class="colour">New York Times</a>)</section>
<section class="third">Another important note is that since the growth of social media, users also share some of their intimate personal information online voluntarily. Without realising the consequences, users choose not to read terms and conditions as they are usually very long and presented in a very technical way therefore they simply agree to share personal information via a Facebook application or in a Twitter platform. Ben Goldacre from the Guardian newspaper intelligently argues that this is what happens when users are caught up in the moment and agree to play a social media game with the developer’s rules. One example Mr Goldacre presents, shows us how personal information could be used the opposite way of its intentions. According to his research, ‘The Girls Around Me’ app takes freely shared social data, intending to help friends get together but by using Foursquare and Facebook data anyone can locate these girls’ whereabouts and with their Facebook profiles linked to the app, it is not difficult to learn their interests or any other information they expose freely online before they even meet with them. (<a href="#one" class="colour">Guardian Article</a>) At the end of the day he says; “Most of us trade security for convenience, you could, after all, make your house incredibly secure by fitting reinforced metal shutters over every window, and 10 locks on a single reinforced front door; but it would take a very long time to get in and out, or see the sunshine in the morning.” (Goldacre, et al.2015) When we look at the Organisations that we share our personal data with and trust to keep it secure, they are not doing any better than us human beings. Ernst & Young’s Global Information Security 2015 Survey results argue that organisations are very vulnerable targets when it comes to the security breach as organisations are not giving security higher priority. Businesses, Governments and Individuals mostly focus on benefits of new technologies and while trying to flourish with rapidly expanding opportunities, many precautions have been overlooked and risks underestimated. For a solution Ernest & Young suggest that organizations recognize current challenges and take the necessary steps to prevent such security breaches. They emphasise four different areas for organisations to focus on:</section>
<ol class="middle">
  <li>What would be todays attacks on digital world,</li>
  <li>How the attacks unfold,</li>
  <li>Why are we still so vulnerable,</li>
  <li>How can we shift to active defence. (<a href="#one" class="colour">EY's Global Information Security Survey, 2015, p. 2</a>)</li>
</ol>

<section class="fourth">Another survey from the UK Government’s Department of Business, Innovation and Skills in 2013 discovered that 93% of large organizations in the UK have experienced some sort of security breach. The survey demonstrates that organizations are valuable targets, as the worst security breaches cost them financially, on average £450.000 - £800.000 each. (<a id="colour" href="#one" class="colour">Skills, 2013, p. 2</a>) While the scale of the cyber-attacks on UK companies are huge, 36% of those down to a human error and further 10% related to staff misuse (<a href="#one" class="colour">Skills, 2013, p. 2</a>). Encouragingly, almost many larger companies now have a written security policy but most of the staff understanding of the policy is still relatively poor, in turn the number of internal security breaches twice more than in organisations where employees had a good understanding of the policy. (<a href="#one" class="colour">Skills, 2013, p. 6</a>) Positively, the survey discovered that attitudes towards information security are generally good and continually improving. (<a href="#one" class="colour">Skills, 2013, p. 4</a>)The survey suggest, that having a strong set of contingency plans in place would reduce the risk of security breaches. (<a href="#one" class="colour">Skills, 2013, p. 18</a>) </section>
<section class="fifth">The Evolving Digital World is being compromised at the same pace as it is growing itself. Whilst we users are not always very diligent against these threats and will often choose convenience over security, many organisations are also not doing their part properly. Anything that is done digitally needs security yet most of us, including organisations, are acting very naively in thinking that once we share our private personal information online that it will be stay there securely and no one will have a reason to breach it.</section>
